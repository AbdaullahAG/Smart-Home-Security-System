# 🔐 Smart Home Security System (IoT Simulation)

This project is a simulation of a smart home security system built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
It demonstrates how **IoT devices** can be integrated to create an automated, responsive home security setup.

## 🏠 System Components

- 🧠 **Controller Tablet** – Controls and monitors the entire system
- 📡 **Home Gateway** – Connects all IoT devices
- 🎥 **CCTV Camera** – Streams live video
- 🚨 **Siren** – Activates on motion detection
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Motion Detector** – Detects movement and triggers the alarm

## ⚙️ How It Works

When the motion detector identifies any movement:
- The siren is automatically activated.
- The CCTV camera begins live streaming to the controller tablet.
- The system operates over a wireless network simulated inside Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- IoT Networking
- Wireless Communication
- Smart Automation Logic
